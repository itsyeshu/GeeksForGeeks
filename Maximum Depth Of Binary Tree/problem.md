## Question statement

Given a binary tree, find its *maximum depth*.
A binary tree's maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the **root** *node* down to the farthest leaf node.

## Example:
```
Input:
root  -->      1
             /   \
            3     2
           /
          4

Output: 3

Explanation:
Maximum depth is between nodes 1 and 4, which is 3.
```

Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Complete the function maxDepth() which takes the root node as an input parameter and returns the maximum depth.
 
 
**Constraints:**
* `1 ≤ N ≤ 10⁵`
* *Expected Time Complexity* : O(N)
* *Expected Auxiliary Space* : O(height of the tree)
